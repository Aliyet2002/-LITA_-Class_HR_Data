# LITA_Class_HR_Data

## Project Overview

The main goal of the HR Data Analytics project is to leverage employee-related data to drive strategic HR decisions, enhance workforce efficiency, and improve overall employee satisfaction and retention. 
This project aims to turn raw HR data into valuable insights, supporting data-driven decision-making across recruitment, retention, talent development, and workforce management.

## Project Scope
The project focuses on:

   -  Collecting and cleaning HR data (employee demographics, performance, engagement, attendance, etc.)
   - Analyzing key metrics related to workforce performance, retention, diversity, and employee satisfaction
   - Identifying trends, patterns, and outliers
   - Developing predictive models for employee attrition, engagement, and career progression

## Data Sources

  - Employee Information: Demographics, education, job role, department, tenure
  -  Performance Data: Annual/quarterly performance reviews, KPIs, manager feedback
  -  Engagement Data: Survey results on job satisfaction, team dynamics, work-life balance
  -  Attendance Records: Absenteeism, sick leaves, vacation days
  -  Compensation Data: Salary, bonuses, promotion history
  -  Learning & Development: Training courses completed, certifications, skill assessments

## Key Metrics and Analysis

   1. Employee Retention and Turnover
       - Attrition rates by department, role, demographics
       - Exit analysis to determine common reasons for departure

   2. Performance and Productivity
       - Performance ratings over time by department and role
       - Relationship between engagement and performance levels

   3. Employee Satisfaction and Engagement
       - Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) from engagement surveys

       - Assessment of representation and equity across roles and levels

   5. Compensation and Benefits
      - Salary benchmarking and trends across roles
      - Analysis of compensation against performance

   6. Predictive Analysis
      - Predictive model for employee attrition based on tenure, performance, engagement, etc.
      - Forecasting staffing needs based on turnover and retirement pattern.
